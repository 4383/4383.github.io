Who Lives by Subsidies Dies by Policies. For many projects funded by subsidy, the withdrawal of this last one represent the end of party. Game over.

Who never observed the wind of subsidies has turned once a new politician is elected or when a new administration sets up his business? Subsidies are not a model to follow to survive from political adventures.

Subsidies are often seen as sexy because they avoid you to search for a business model. Subsidies are time to time chosen as funding model for free software projects. 

In a previous life I was an entrepreneur. Trust me, starting a business is anything but easy. I founded a grocery business, not such a tech company. I funded my business on public subsidies and you know what? I went bankrupt. Harsh. 

I spent thousand hours trying to understand what I made wrong, and you know why, I found that I started with no plan, and subsidies pushed me in the void. I totally ignored the market, and I totally removed the customer from my initial equations. Subsidies lied me by letting me trusting that I was in the right direction.

Subsidies are often delivered by people that are not entrepreneur - collectivities, administrations, etc - and unfortunatelly who won't never been. Subsiders only follow political agenda. Subsidies are given in regards with the current politics. Their goal is to dynamise such or such part of economics. The problem is that that's not the local administration that decide what works or not, that's the customers. Usefulness is not decreed by law, it is determined by customers. If the next politician from another camp decide to reduce expenses, you'll perish from lack of revenue.

Customers are the only persons that you can trust. They are the only persons that you can count on. You have to put in the middle of your business. No customer no venture.

You do not need tons of customers. You simply need really good customers with a good average basket that you can articulate to adjust your revenues.

A market study is not enough to start a business. You should consider the value above all. The price is what your customer pay for, the value is what he get. Think twice about the value your offer, and seek for a business model that match where is positioned your additional value. What is value? Value is simply a real and effective solution to a painful problem. If you do not resolve a problem then you have no business and even no products.

If people feel that you bring a solution to their problems, then they will consume your products. They will invest in your business. Several business models today make it possible to combine free software with commercial sustainability.

You need a plan to start your journey so here are 3 models that you can apply to your free software business.

The first, popularized by Red Hat, is the Support & Services model. In this model the software is open source, but professional support is paid. The source code, documentation, and basic updates are available for free, while technical support, training, custom integration, 24/7 enterprise support, and security guarantees are offered as paid services. A prime example is Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). This model rewards in-depth product expertise but requires a strong technical team on the client side.

Another approach is the Open Core model, used by companies like GitLab, Elastic, and MongoDB. The core of the product is open source, but advanced featuresâ€”such as SAML authentication, advanced monitoring, dashboards, or backup/restore toolsâ€”are reserved for paid versions. For instance, GitLab CE (Community Edition) is free, while GitLab EE (Enterprise Edition) includes premium modules. This model helps attract a broad community while monetizing professional use cases, though it can sometimes draw criticism when the line between open and proprietary becomes blurry.

Finally, the Hosted SaaS model offers a different path: the software remains open, but its hosted version, delivered as a service, is monetized. Users can self-host the tool at no cost, but fully managed, secure, and scalable cloud offerings are available for a fee. Examples include Sentry, GitLab.com, or Odoo. This model lowers adoption barriers for clients but demands strong DevOps expertise and infrastructure from the provider.

In face of subsidies you have to behaves like Ulysse when he faced the mermaids. Tie yourself to the mast of your ship and think twice about your business model. Politician are mermaid that try to attract electors to them. If you want your business to survive you should not be in the middle of a political battle.
