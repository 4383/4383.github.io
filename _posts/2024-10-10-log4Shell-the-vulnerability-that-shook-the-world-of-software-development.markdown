In December 2021, a critical security vulnerability named Log4Shell was discovered in
the Log4j library, a logging tool widely used in Java applications around the world.
Identified as CVE-2021-44228, it was quickly labeled as one of the most severe of the
decade. The NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) gave it a score of
10/10 on the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), marking its maximum level of
severity.

What seemed like an ordinary logging management tool suddenly became a potential entry
point for attacks. Log4j, essential for many Java applications, exposed critical
infrastructures to a significant risk. If you were using Log4j in your projects, you
probably remember the frenzy that followed.

After the vulnerability was discovered, many attacks targeted unpatched servers. You
likely asked yourself at the time, "Is my system vulnerable?" Giants like RedHat, Amazon
Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud quickly issued urgent alerts. But
beyond the patches, this incident raised a broader question: how could such a widespread
and reliable technology cause such disruption?

The financial costs were substantial for many companies, and technical teams—perhaps
yours—had to respond quickly to fix the flaw and protect critical infrastructures.
Service interruptions and successful attacks resulted in significant losses. But could
this crisis have been avoided?

## A method to prevent future incidents: Integrated analysis of your technologies

The Log4Shell incident was a reminder to everyone about the importance of anticipation.
A widely adopted technology can sometimes reveal unexpected vulnerabilities. So, what
can you do to avoid being caught off guard next time?

By adopting an integrated approach to evaluating technologies, you can identify issues
before they become critical. This methodology helps you assess your tools from multiple
angles—technical, financial, ethical, and even environmental—so you can make informed
decisions and avoid unpleasant surprises.

### Why is a multidimensional approach essential?

Before starting your evaluation, ask yourself this question: do you evaluate your
technologies holistically, or do you focus only on one aspect, such as security or cost?
A problem rarely arises in just one area. By analyzing at least two criteria, you can
spot warning signs and avoid interpretative bias.

For example, had you evaluated Log4j before the Log4Shell incident, you might have
identified that:

- **Security:** Log4j had not undergone regular security audits.
- **Finance:** Its maintenance was handled by a small volunteer team, a major risk for
  relying on it for critical systems.

These signs could have alerted you and encouraged proactive measures. A multidimensional
approach helps you better anticipate risks.

### Key areas for a complete evaluation

Here are a few essential areas to consider when evaluating your technologies. Whether
you're a developer or a manager, have you thought about evaluating technologies in
this way?

#### 1. Finance

- **Maintenance cost:** Are the technologies you use profitable in the long run? Log4j
  was free, but its vulnerability cost millions in fixes. Could one of your libraries
  face the same fate?
- **Return on Investment (ROI):** Do your tools bring more value than risk? If you
  reevaluated your tools today, what financial aspects would stand out?

#### 2. Legal Compliance

- **Regulations:** Do your technologies comply with current regulations, like GDPR? In
  case of a security breach, would you still be in compliance?
- **Litigation risks:** Could a latent issue in your tools expose your company to legal
  action?

#### 3. Productivity

- **Efficiency:** Do your tools support or hinder your teams' productivity?
- **Adoption:** Is the tool you're using poorly documented or hard to adopt? Are your
  teams struggling with it?

#### 4. Security

- **Regular audits:** Are your technologies regularly tested for security
  vulnerabilities?
- **Recurring incidents:** Does a technology present frequent, albeit minor, issues?
  These signals shouldn’t be ignored.

#### 5. Ethics

- **Privacy:** Do the technologies you use respect user privacy? A vulnerability could
  compromise sensitive data.
- **Bias:** Do the tools you use generate biases, fostering injustice or discrimination?

#### 6. Environment

- **Energy impact:** Have you assessed the environmental footprint of the technologies
  you use?
- **Sustainability:** Are your tools designed to last?

#### 7. Evolution/Compatibility

- **Obsolescence:** Will the technology you're relying on today still be relevant in
  five years?
- **Incompatibilities:** Do frequent incompatibilities with other systems slow down your
  progress?

#### 8. User Experience (UX)

- **Complexity:** If a tool is too complex, how much time are you wasting training your
  teams?
- **Support and accessibility:** Is the support around the tool you're using sufficient?

## Take action now!

The Log4Shell case is a reminder: could your projects face a similar risk? Every
developer and technical team must adopt constant vigilance in the selection and
management of their technologies. Don't wait for the next crisis to react.

### What actions should you take?

- **Immediate audit:** Analyze the critical technologies in your systems. What areas
  are at risk? If, during your audit, you identify issues in two distinct areas, then
  you can consider that you have diagnosed a genuine problem.
- **Update plan:** Implement a regular maintenance plan. Are all your tools up to date
  and secure?
- **Invest in security:** Never underestimate the importance of regular audits and
  security testing.

Don't wait for the next crisis to act. Use this evaluation grid today to ensure that
your technologies are robust, secure, and ready for the future.
